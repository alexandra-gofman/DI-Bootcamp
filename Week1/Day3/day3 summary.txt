DATA STRUCTURES

List: a sequence of ordered elements that can be changed (mutable)
Tuple: a sequence of ordered elements that are immutable (can't be changed)
Set: a sequence of unordered elements that are not duplicated is mutable (can be changed)

Most used List methods:
index(x) – returns the index of the first occurrence of x
append(x) – adds x to the end of the list
insert(i, x) – inserts x at position i
sort() – sorts the list in place (modifies the list)
sorted() – returns a new sorted list (original list stays the same)
pop(i) – removes and returns the element at index i (last by default)
remove(x) – removes the first occurrence of x
extend(list2) – adds all elements from list2 to the end of the list
sum() – returns the sum of all elements (numbers only)
min() – returns the smallest element
max() – returns the largest element

Tuple methods:
index(x) – returns the index of the first occurrence of x
count(x) – returns how many times x appears
sum() – returns the sum of all elements
min() – returns the smallest element
max() – returns the largest element
Note: Tuples are immutable, so they don’t support methods like append() or remove().

Set methods:
union(set2) – returns a set with elements from both sets
intersection(set2) – returns a set with only elements common to both
difference(set2) – returns elements in the first set but not in set2
