suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the error message in the `__add__` and `__iadd__` methods should dynamically reflect the actual currency types being added, rather than hardcoding 'dollar' and 'shekel'.
- Exercise 1: The `__str__` and `__repr__` methods could be simplified using f-strings and conditional expressions to avoid redundant code.
- Exercise 3: The random string generation can be made more concise using the `random.choices` function.
- Exercise 5: The output formatting in Exercise 5 can be improved for better readability.  Consider using a more structured approach to display the time difference (e.g., separating days, hours, minutes, etc., more clearly).
- Exercise 6: Add input validation to handle potential errors if the user enters an invalid date format.
